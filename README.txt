Meeting in the Middle (QRT)
1 winner
QRT has 13 global, collaborative offices.
Colleagues from multiple offices need to meet in person.
Where should the meeting be held?

Your task:
Design a tool or algorithm to identify the best host location (not necessarily an office) - balancing:
Carbon emissions from travel
Fairness in travel distance/time

We’re partnering with OAG, a global leader in travel data, providing flight schedules and CO₂ emissions data. 
You may also use open-source data (e.g. pricing, train times, geography) to enhance your analysis.
